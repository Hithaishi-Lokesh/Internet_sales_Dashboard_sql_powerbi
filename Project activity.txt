Focus on - transforming and cleaning data while referring to user story and business demand 

Analysing the difference between Fact Table and dimension table, we will identity required tables based on business requirement and user story 

In data warehousing and database design, fact tables and dimension tables are fundamental concepts, often used together in star or snowflake schemas. Here’s a breakdown of each:

Fact Table
Definition: A fact table is a central table in a star schema of a data warehouse. It contains quantitative data for analysis and is often denormalized.
Characteristics:
Measures: It stores numeric data or measurements, such as sales amount, quantities sold, profit, etc.
Keys: It typically contains foreign keys that reference dimension tables (e.g., customer ID, product ID, date ID).
Granularity: The level of detail; for example, sales data could be at the transaction level (each sale) or aggregated (monthly sales).
Example: A FactstoreSales table that records sales transactions, with columns for sales amount, quantity, customer ID, and date.
Dimension Table
Definition: A dimension table contains attributes that describe the objects in the fact table. It provides context to the facts and is generally denormalized.
Characteristics:
Descriptive Attributes: It includes textual or categorical data, such as product names, customer demographics, or dates.
Primary Keys: Each dimension table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each record, which is referenced by the fact table.
Hierarchies: Dimensions often contain hierarchies that allow for data to be analyzed at different levels (e.g., year → quarter → month).
Example: A dimCustomers table that includes customer IDs, names, addresses, and other demographic information.
Key Differences
Purpose: Fact tables store measurable, quantitative data; dimension tables store descriptive, contextual information.
Data Type: Fact tables primarily contain numerical data; dimension tables contain qualitative data.
Structure: Fact tables are usually larger and contain more rows; dimension tables are smaller and contain more columns with descriptive attributes.
Relationships: Fact tables reference dimension tables through foreign keys to establish relationships for analysis.
Summary
In a typical data analysis scenario, the fact table provides the data you want to analyze, while dimension tables give context to that data, allowing for meaningful insights through querying and reporting.
